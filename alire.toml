   Adare_Net is a small, powerfull, portable and easy to use Ada network lib.

      Adare_Net is a small, powerfull, portable and easy to use Ada network lib.
      It supports ipv4 ipv6 udp tcp raw level 2 and raw level 3,
      Fully Asynchronous Use but with Internal Avanced Synchronous I/O Multiplexing
      and can 'listen' with ipv6, too.

      The powerfull buffer feature can support all Ada types, tagged types included,
      and with a more refined treatment, you can use endian proof records and
      unconstrained arrays.

      The Fully Asynchronous Use with Internal Avanced Synchronous
      I/O Multiplexing feature together with Ada tasks and protected types, makes
      the use of non-blocking sockets unnecessary.

      All supported OS's have exactly the same visible packages names and children
      packages names!  Just 'with' Adare_Net packages without worrying about
      different package names.

      Before Version 8.0.0 this is a work in progress.
